# upsteam-knowledges
Knowledges learnt from reading source code of upstream projects.



From time to time, I need to read the source code of upstream projects( e.g Qt, GTK, FreeRDP, laptop-mode-tools, system-config-printer, kwin and on and on), and I always forget things about them( e.g how to build them, how to update the pot/po, how to debug and so on), so here I created this repo to write down the knowledges learnt from them, so I can check them after.In one word, it's a wiki of the source code. 



Content can be seen in the [wiki](https://github.com/hualet/upsteam-knowledges/wiki) page.
